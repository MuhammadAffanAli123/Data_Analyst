The mean is equal to the sum of all the values in the data set divided by the number of values in the data set. 

Formula for sample Data
		¯x=(x_1+x_2+⋯+x_n)/n
 
Formula for Population Data
		¯x=(∑x)/n


Median

The median is the middle score for a set of data that has been arranged in order of magnitude. The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data.

Mode

The mode is the most frequent score in our data set. On a histogram it represents the highest bar in a bar chart or histogram. You can, therefore, sometimes consider the mode as being the most popular option
